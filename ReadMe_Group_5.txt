# Fibonacci heaps analysis and comparison with Binary Heap

It is a implementation of Fibonacci heaps and its comparison with Binary Heap

## Usage
Run `main.c` file to run Fibonacci heaps and perform different opperations and at end it will display the time taken

Run `binaryHeap.c` file to run Binaru heaps and perform different opperations and at end it will display the time taken

## Fibonacci Heap vs Binary Heap
Fibonacci heaps support deletion and decrease key `O(log n)` amortized time and all other standard heap operations in `O(1)` amortized time. Wherea Binary Heap take `O(log n)` for most of the operations and `O(n)` for union. Fibonacci heaps can perform union in `O(1)` amortized time

testcase/ cointains examples run on some test cases
